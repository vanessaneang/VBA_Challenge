# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to see if we could make our code run faster if we **_refactored_**, or edited, the code to loop through our stock analysis. In the end the result analyzed the stocks total daily volume and rate of return based on the stock tickers. 

## Results

The original code only had one array defined for the tickers and one conditional for loop. It also formatted the table in a separate macro, so the time reflected for the 2017 and 2018 analyses does not reflect the entire time.
